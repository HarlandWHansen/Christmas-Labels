+---------------+--------------+--------------+
| This entry spans these cols  | This entry   |

Link to external URL: `Apple main web site <http://www.apple.com>`_ that way.

Reference to a reference elswhere in the same document:  `Link to elsewhere`_

Blah blah

    _`Link to elsewhere`   <-- This is the target of the link above.

To reference another document use

    :doc:`title <doc name and location>`

    Must not be a space between the : and the backtick!

    Can also use :any: - it will try to do :doc:, :ref:, etc.

        If not found, will then try to find a Python object with that name
        and link to it (e.g. class name, function name, module name, etc.)

Glossary-type definition
    The definition for the term must be indented and immediately below
    the term.

    Blank lines may appear in the definition body, but must not
    come between the term and the first line of definition.

    The term defined can be referenced elsewhere by :term:,
    e.g. :Glossary-type definition:
