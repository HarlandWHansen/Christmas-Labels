# Christmas Labels

Manage a simple contact list for the purpose of printing labels
for Christmas cards from it.

Project Highlights:

*   Written in modern Python

*   Documented with Sphinx

*   Probably written intirely by the repository maintainer (although
    help from others will be enthusiastically considered)

*   Open source

In addition to being useful in and of itself,  this project is meant
to show the evolution of a project from conception to production.
